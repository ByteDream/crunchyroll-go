_This repo originally contained a cli client too but to provide more flexibility it got moved to its own repository.
You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ByteDream/crunchy-cli). For more context see [this issue](https://github.com/ByteDream/crunchy-cli/issues/39)._

# üìö Library

# ‚òùÔ∏è Disclaimer
